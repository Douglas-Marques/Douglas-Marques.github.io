        <p>Hi, I'm Douglas Marques a guy from Brazil who loves code. I'm 22 yo right now. Currently in the fourth semester
          of System Analysis and Development at Universidade do Vale do Rio do Sinos (UNISINOS) (4/6 I can't believe) and
          doing at the same time the Cognitive Class Data Science path. And finding time to study Web Development, why not?

        <h3>Unisinos</h3>
        <h6>Student - System Analysis and Development</h6>
        <p>Universidade do Vale do Rio do Sinos (or UNISINOS) is an important university in the south of Brasil. I am studying
          at the Campus of Porto Alegre, a modern space to develop my career. I chose System Analysis and Development (or
          SAD, no, wait...) because it has a more modern curriculum than others technology courses and because I recognize
          myself more as a multidisciplinary person.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="job job-2">
        <h3>Cognitive Class</h3>
        <h6>Student - Data Science and Big Data</h6>
        <p>Cognitiveclass.ai (also known as Big Data University) is an IBM project made to everyone who wants to discover
          the world of Data Science and Big Data. I recently decided to reorganize my career and I made a move to the new
          world of data. It's an amazing universe with a whole set of hard and soft skills, and the more I studied, the more
          I realized how difficult it would be this path. That's when I find Cognitive Class and the lerning paths seted
          up by IBM specialists.</p>

        <h3>Experiences</h3>
        <h6>Internship and projects</h6>
        <p>Although I am still new to this world of technology, I have had some opportunities, both from college and/or personal
          studies. You can see on <a class="important" href="work.html">my projects page</a> some of them.</p>
